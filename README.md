In this project, I have trained an SVM model on images of 5 cricket players from India - Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Mohammad Shami, MS Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar.
Out of SVM, RandomForest and Logistic Regression, SVM performed the best in my case so I have used that model to detect players in the website

The link to the dataset used to train this model is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eQsg9AH66i2y7TF2STUBoMqjAjI2umJ8?usp=drive_link
Feel free to add more images to the dataset as it can improve the score of the model.
The images for this project was downloaded from google by searching player name and using a chrome extension called "FAKTUN"

This project is made taking reference from the following project: https://github.com/codebasics/py/tree/master/DataScience/CelebrityFaceRecognition
